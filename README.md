## Explanation of run_analysis.R script
============================================================================================

The R script can be split into 7 parts based on the activity being done:
1. Setting Working directory and reading the required files
2. Merging the test and train data sets
3. Extracting only measurements of mean and standard deviation
4. Naming the activities descriptively
5. Naming the variables of dataset descriptively
6. Creating a final dataset with average of all variables for each subject and each activity
